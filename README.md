# BayesianNN_model_estimation
Using Bayasian neural network to learn the transition models of sevaral different robotic environments.<br />
Used three different environments: robotic hand in gazebo simulator, real robotic hand, arctobot.<br />
Neural Network structure save in common/BNN.py<br />
Run env/<environment_name>/regression for estimating dynamics<br />
Run env/<environment_name>/prediction to test the NN model with test trajectory<br />
